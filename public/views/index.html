        <h2>About This Page</h2>
        <p>I'm a former park ranger learning to code. Everyone suggests project-based coding as the best way to learn. I
            always wanted there to be a map function on USA Jobs, so I made one.</p>

        <p>Turns out, learning to code is really challenging when you don't know anything about it. I
            learned in fits and starts, C# (gamedev), JS (webdev), Python. Little of this, little of that. Finally,
            after
            starting a GIS certificate, I decided to get on with this and make it for my portfolio.</p>

        <p>I call the data from the USAJOBS API and then parse it, extracting what I need. Then I use Leaflet.js for the
            map, and iterate through the jobs I pulled to populate the pins. If a job has multiple locations listed, or
            the API data doesn't have a location listed, it goes in the "Jobs with Multiple Locations" table.</p>

        <p>I may return to this and work on the JS code to more elegantly handle the API data and gussy up the styling.
            CSS is
            not my favorite, though. This is it for now. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
